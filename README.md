# net-core-scaffolding README

This extention is meant to replicate the scaffolding function for .Net Core MVC projects found in Visual Studio on Windows.

Right-click on a .Net class and select Scaffold MVC. This will prompt you to install any missing dependencies and then ask you a couple of questions before scaffolding the controller and views.
